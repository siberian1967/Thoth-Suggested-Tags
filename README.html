<h1>Thoth's Tag Suggestions</h1>

<p>Version 1.0 - July 1, 2010
Compatible with WordPress 3.0 or higher</p>

<p>by Jimmy O'Higgins</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Thoth's Tag Suggestions is a WordPress plugin that recommends tags by scanning a post and displaying recurring words and phrases as a tag cloud.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Upload the thoth-tag-suggestions folder to your wp-content/plugins folder.</p>

<p>Go to the "Plugins" administration panel.</p>

<p>Activate Thoth's Suggested Tags</p>

<p>Thoth is now with you.</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>

<p>Every time the user saves a draft or updates a post, Thoth</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Splits the post content into chunks delimited by stop-characters.</p></li>
<li><p>Uses a simple <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=k-mer+counting" title="Google search">k-mer counting</a> algorithm to record every possible phrase in the content and its frequency.</p></li>
<li><p>Does post-processing on the phrase list and displays the final list as a tag cloud. For more information consult the "Features" section.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Tag strength (<code>$strength</code> in the code) is an integer representing the likelihood of the tag being appropriate to the post. A tag's strength is initially determined by its frequency in the post.</p></li>
<li><p>Stop Words - Filters out phrases beginning or ending with any words in the stop-word list.</p></li>
<li><p>Tag length - Tag strength is multiplied by the number of words in the tag with a maximum of 3. This means that longer recurring phrases are ranked higher than shorter ones.</p></li>
<li><p>Pluralization - For every potential single-word tag, Thoth adds a plural suffix 's' and searches for matches in the potential tag list. If a match is found, the tag strength of the singular is transferred to the plural version (e.g. "download" becomes "downloads"). If a match is not found, the singular is used.</p></li>
<li><p>Existing tags - Thoth also retrieves all the tags used in your blog and searches for instances of them in the content of the post. In the case of a match, the tag strength is multiplied by 2 and incremented by the number of times that tag has been used in your blog. This means that if your blog has a unifying theme, certain tags are likely to be reused and will enable Thoth to make better suggestions.</p></li>
</ul>
